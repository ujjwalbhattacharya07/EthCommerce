## EthCommerce

### The problem EthCommerce solves

EthCommerce is an online platform that helps creators, developers, and entrepreneurs sell their products directly to their audience. The problem EthCommerce solves is independent creators' challenges when trying to sell their products online. EthCommerce removes all intermediaries and gives direct access to the audience. Developed on different chains, buyers can choose to buy courses on their favourite chain. Our platform charges minimal fees, and that too only when the creator decides to withdraw the money. All the data is stored on IPFS, so there is no chance that the data will be lost. EthCommerce provides full flexibility and a real connection with the audience. With QuickNode alerts, we send messages to the audience and creators whenever a new course is created or purchased.

### Challenges we ran into

We studied Mantle and how it offers promising scalable solutions to the Ethereum ecosystem. Deploying stuff on Mantle was an issue as the testnet was not stable and had some issues, but we were able to get it done. Connecting Mantle along with the Wagmi library was an issue for the frontend integration and thus we later shifted to ethers.js to connect to the smart contracts.
Making a minimalistic UI for making it easier for the users to create stuff was also a hassle.
